# Code Quality Enforcement Guide - Streamlined

This document outlines the streamlined code quality enforcement system implemented in this Flask project. Our focused approach maintains high code quality standards while avoiding over-engineering and circular dependencies.

## üéØ Overview

Our streamlined code quality enforcement system operates at essential levels:

1. **Pre-commit Hooks** - Essential checks without auto-fixes
2. **Quality Monitoring** - Comprehensive metrics tracking
3. **Development Tools** - Simplified command interface
4. **Manual Fixes** - Controlled code improvements

## üöÄ Quick Start for New Developers

### Quick Setup

Set up your development environment with one command:

```bash
# Complete development setup
make setup
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Install all dependencies
- ‚úÖ Configure pre-commit hooks
- ‚úÖ Set up development environment

### Manual Setup (if needed)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-optional.txt

# 2. Set up pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks provide immediate feedback with check-only validation to prevent circular loops.

### Configured Hooks

#### General Code Quality

- **check-yaml/json/toml** - Validates file formats
- **check-added-large-files** - Prevents large files (>1MB)
- **check-case-conflict** - Detects case conflicts
- **check-merge-conflict** - Detects merge conflict markers
- **debug-statements** - Prevents debug statements
- **detect-private-key** - Prevents committing secrets

#### Python-Specific (Check-Only)

- **ruff** - Fast linting and style checking
- **ruff-format** - Code formatting validation
- **mypy** - Static type checking
- **bandit** - Security vulnerability scanning
- **interrogate** - Docstring coverage checking

#### Custom Hooks

- **Blueprint structure validation**
- **URL prefix consistency checking**

### Hook Management

```bash
# Run all hooks on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run specific hook
pre-commit run ruff

# Skip hooks for emergency commits (use sparingly)
git commit --no-verify -m "Emergency fix"

# Update hook versions
pre-commit autoupdate
```

## üö¶ Quality Checks

Our streamlined quality system focuses on essential checks:

### Core Quality Checks

1. **Linting and Formatting**
   - ‚ùå **FAILS** if ruff finds linting issues
   - ‚ùå **FAILS** if code formatting is incorrect
   - ‚ùå **FAILS** if mypy finds type errors
   - ‚ùå **FAILS** if bandit finds security vulnerabilities
   - ‚ùå **FAILS** if docstring coverage is below 80%

2. **Testing**
   - ‚ùå **FAILS** if test coverage is below configured threshold
   - ‚ùå **FAILS** if any tests fail

### Helpful Error Messages

The system provides actionable error messages:

```
‚ùå Code formatting check failed. Run 'make fix' to fix.
‚ùå Linting check failed. Fix the issues above.
‚ùå Type checking failed. Add proper type hints.
‚ùå Security vulnerabilities found. Review and fix.
‚ùå Docstring coverage below 80%. Add missing docstrings.
```

## üìä Quality Monitoring

### Quality Monitor Script

The `quality_monitor.py` script provides comprehensive quality tracking:

```bash
# Single quality check
make quality

# Or run directly
python scripts/quality_monitor.py
```

### Monitored Metrics

- **Test Coverage** - Percentage of code covered by tests
- **Docstring Coverage** - Percentage of functions/classes with docstrings
- **Type Coverage** - Quality of type annotations
- **Complexity Score** - Cyclomatic complexity average
- **Code Duplication** - Percentage of duplicated code
- **Linting Issues** - Number of style/quality violations
- **Security Issues** - Number of security vulnerabilities
- **Technical Debt** - Estimated time to fix all issues
- **Quality Score** - Overall score (0-10)

### Quality Thresholds

| Metric | Good | Warning | Error |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| Test Coverage | ‚â•80% | 60-79% | <60% |
| Docstring Coverage | ‚â•90% | 70-89% | <70% |
| Type Coverage | ‚â•80% | 60-79% | <60% |
| Complexity Score | ‚â§10 | 11-15 | >15 |
| Code Duplication | ‚â§5% | 6-10% | >10% |
| Linting Issues | 0 | 1-5 | >5 |
| Security Issues | 0 | - | >0 |
| Quality Score | ‚â•8.0 | 6.0-7.9 | <6.0 |

### Historical Tracking

The monitor maintains a history of quality metrics in `.quality_metrics.json`:

- Tracks trends over time
- Shows improvement/degradation patterns
- Helps identify quality debt accumulation

## üõ†Ô∏è Essential Commands

### Streamlined Development Commands

```bash
# Essential workflow commands
make setup              # Set up development environment
make test               # Run tests with coverage
make lint               # Run all quality checks
make fix                # Auto-fix code issues
make dev                # Start development server

   ```bash
   make fix
   ```

3. **Monitor code quality regularly**

   ```bash
   make quality
   ```

4. **Write tests for new code**
   - Maintain >80% test coverage
   - Include unit and integration tests

5. **Add type hints**
   - Use proper type annotations
   - Aim for >80% type coverage

6. **Document your code**
   - Add docstrings to all functions/classes
   - Maintain >80% docstring coverage

### For Team Leads

1. **Monitor quality trends**

   ```bash
   make quality
   ```

2. **Set quality thresholds**
   - Adjust thresholds in quality_monitor.py
   - Gradually increase standards over time

3. **Review quality metrics in code reviews**
   - Check quality score changes
   - Ensure technical debt doesn't accumulate

4. **Onboard new developers properly**
