# Cursor AI Rules for Flask Production Template for AI

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Read AI Instructions First

Before writing ANY code, you MUST read and follow the guidelines in `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

This file contains:
- Project architecture and coding standards
- Directory structure rules
- Development workflow guidelines
- Code generation templates
- Testing guidelines

## Quick Setup Command

```bash
# Read the AI instructions first
cat AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md

# Then run the quickstart
./scripts/quickstart.sh          # macOS/Linux
.\scripts\quickstart.ps1         # Windows
```

## Key Rules

1. **Always read `AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` before coding**
2. Follow the established directory structure in `app/`
3. Use the blueprint templates in `__template__/`
4. Maintain test coverage with every change
5. Follow the coding standards defined in the AI instructions
